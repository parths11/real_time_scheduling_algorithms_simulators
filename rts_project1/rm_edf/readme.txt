* Before running the simulators please change the path to the input file and path to the output file in the source code rm.c and edf.c


* It has been indicated in the source codes rm.c and edf.c where the path to the input file and path to the output file has to be changed.


* To compile the rm simulator type the following command on the command line in the current directory:
	gcc my_func.c rm.c -o rm
and then run the simulator using:
	./rm
	
	
* To compile the edf simulator type the following command on the command line in the current directory:
	gcc my_func.c edf.c -o edf
and then run the simulator using:
	./edf
	
	
* The file sample_rmoutput.txt is the output file generated when the input to the rm simulator is question1_taskset.txt. Here the taskset has utilization less than 1.


* The file sample_rmoutput_overload.txt is the output file generated when the input to the rm simulator is question1_taskset_overload.txt. Here the taskset is overloaded and has utilization more than 1.


* The file sample_edfoutput.txt is the output file generated when the input to the edf simulator is question1_taskset.txt. Here the taskset has utilization less than 1.


* The file sample_edfoutput_overload.txt is the output file generated when the input to the edf simulator is question1_taskset_overload.txt. Here the taskset is overloaded and has utilization more than 1.


* The file rm_vs_edf.pdf contains the differences between the schedules generated by the rm and the edf simulator.


* All the coding and testing was done on UBUNTU 16.04
